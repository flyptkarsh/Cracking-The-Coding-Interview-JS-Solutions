## Ruby Solutions
The problems in Cracking The Coding Interview are in Java, but I work in Javascript.

I was thinking of writing algorithms some Medium articles on for non-CS majors. 

The problem numbers are for the 6th edition of Gayle Laakmann McDowell's book
'Cracking the Coding Interview', which I highly recommend you purchase [here.](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850) are not in Ruby or Javascript.
